                <p> I have been working at <b>Oxygen Forensics</b> as a marketing operations specialist for <i>3 years</i> now. My responsibilities include management of the website and CRM. These responsibilities include understanding various coding languages: <b>HTML, CSS, javascript, php, and Deluge</b>. Having the ability to read and understand most HTML and CSS I wanted to be able to write it as well and have the ability to build a multi-page website from the ground up.</p>
                 <p>I graduated from the <b>University of Idaho</b> with a degree in <i>Advertising and a minor in Marketing</i> in 2020. I then found my passion in digital marketing when taking my first position as Digital Marketing Specialist and was introduced to <b>WordPress</b>.</p><br/>
