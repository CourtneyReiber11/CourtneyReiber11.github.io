        <p>LANGLEY, VA&mdash;A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
        
        <p>According to the report, sections of the document&mdash; <em>&mdash;almost invariably the most crucial passages&mdash;</em> &mdash;are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
        
        <p><strong>CIA Director Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The Cold War</li>
            <li>The civil-rights movement</li>
            <li>The growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
